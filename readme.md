The concept idea was to create a "personal" clone of the famous site https://stackoverflow.com.
The beauty of the project was to practice building an SPA (Single Page Application) based on Laravel, Vue and lots of passion (...and time).
For learning purposes, I wanted to integrate JWT, as authentication tool, and Vuetify, as a styling library.
